# AirMessage update generator utility

This is a utility that combines data from user-editable configuration files,
and combines them to an optimized JSON file.

This output format is used on AirMessage Server 4.0+.

## Usage instructions

An example of the file hierarchy consumed and generated by the program is this:
```
- input
    - stable
        - update.yml
        - notes-en.md
        - notes-fr.md
    - beta
        - update.yml
        - notes-en.md
        - notes-fr.md
- output
    - stable.json
    - beta.json
```

In the `input` folder, each subfolder represents an update channel,
that will generate the corresponding `channelname.json` file in the `output` folder.

In each channel folder, the `update.yml` is read, converted to JSON,
and written to the output JSON file.

`notes-(lang).ext` files are read, and merged into the output JSON file like so:

```json
{
	"notes": {
		"lang": "(language code from file name)",
		"message": "(file content as text)"
	}
}
```
